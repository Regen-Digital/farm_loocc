## Features

This module provides an integration with the LOOC-C API to create LRF ACCU
estimates in bulk for farmOS Land Assets. These ACCU estimates are saved so
that they can be viewed and compared with estimates across the entire farm at a
later time.

- Form for creating estimates in bulk or individually
- Table view of all estimates for comparing values.
- TODO: Map of estimates.
- TODO: Ability to save scenarios.
